Earplugs will be a Sabnzbd+ / torrent based music downloader based on the idea of Headphones.
The setup will be a little bit different though, it will incorporate a music sorter but not iTunes based.
I probably will start with a directory structured music collection, and go for a TOP50 approach, 
rss list or something like that with plugins for music websites. 

Although these ideas currently only exists on paper, we'll see what happens.

Headphones repo: https://github.com/rembo10/headphones (I recommend this if you want a working version). 

I will base my code on the structure of current projects as sickbeard and couchpotato. 
Feel free to contribute, I expect a somewhat working version around the beginning of July 2011.
